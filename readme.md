# WordPress-Trial-App
This is just to see how easy and quick it is to use WordPress

I set this up in about half a day, I just wanted to see how WordPress works as it seems to be very popular, so I did this.  It is nothing special, just an exercise in using WordPress.

It has a few pages: the usual "home", "about", etc.

There is a youtube video feed page and a google map.  There is also a youtube link and a twitter feed (which won't work now as I removed my private API keys before putting it on GitHub).
